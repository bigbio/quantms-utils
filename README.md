Python package with scripts and functions for the [quantms workflow](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms) for the analysis of quantitative proteomics data.

The package is available on PyPI: [quantms-utils](https://pypi.org/project/quantms-utils/)
```
pip install quantms-utils
```

## Available Scripts 

The following functionalities are available in the package:

### Diann scripts

- `dianncfg` - Create a configuration file for Diann including enzymes, modifications, and other parameters.
- `diann2mztab` - Convert Diann output to mzTab format. In addition, convert DIA-NN output to MSstats, Triqler or mzTab.
    The output formats are used for quality control and downstream analysis in quantms.

### SDRF scripts

- `openms2sample` - Extra sample information from OpenMS experimental design file. An example of OpenMS experimental design file is available [here](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms-utils/blob/dev/tests/test_data/BSA_design_urls.tsv).
- `checksamplesheet` - Check the sample sheet for errors and inconsistencies. The experimental design coult be an OpenMS experimental design file or and SDRF file. 

### ms2rescore scripts

- `ms2rescore` - Rescore MS2 spectra using the MS2PIP model. The output is a mzML file with the rescored MS2 spectra.

### Features to percolator scripts

- `sage2feature` - The add_sage_feature function enhances an idXML file by appending additional features from a Sage feature table, excluding those generated by 'psm_file'.
- `spectrum2feature`  - Add the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the feature table for percolator.

### Other scripts

- `psmconvert` - The convert_psm function converts peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) from an idXML file to a CSV file, optionally filtering out decoy matches. It extracts and processes data from both the idXML and an associated spectra file, handling multiple search engines and scoring systems.
- `mzmlstats` - The `mzmlstats` processes mass spectrometry data files in either `.mzML` or `Bruker .d` formats to extract and compile statistics about the spectra. It supports generating detailed or ID-only CSV files based on the spectra data.
